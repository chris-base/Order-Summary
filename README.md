### What I learned

This was my first complete project I used Sass/Scss, which was very very helpful in learning about variables and better ways to organize the css. I learned about nesting and how to access certain elements based on their parent, as well as how to nest hover/active styling within the element.

```css
#button-cancel-order {
  &:hover {
		
	}
}
```
